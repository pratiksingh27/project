            Navy Day is celebrated to invoke the memory of the launch of Operation Trident during the Indo-Pak war in 1971. The day is celebrated as a mark of reverence to those who were martyred in the war.<br>
             
            <b>What was Operation Trident?</b><br>
             
            Operation Trident was conducted in the night intervening December 4 and 5 when the Navy launched an attack on the Pakistan Naval Headquarters in Karachi. India drowned four Pakistani vessels and ravaged the Karachi harbour fuel fields. The operation killed over 500 Pakistani Navy personnel, while the Indian side suffered no losses. 
             
            Operation Trident was followed up with another attack by the Indian Navy, code-named Operation Python. Again, India did not suffer any losses in the offensive and managed to damage Pakistani fleet tanker PNS Dacca beyond repair while causing them to lose the Kemari Oil Storage facility as well.
